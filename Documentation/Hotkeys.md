## Hotkeys Documentation

You can easily define custom hotkeys by configuring custom settings.

Any setting starting with ``hotkeys.`` is considered a hotkey setting.

For example, one can set a hotkey to jump to a specific desktop by setting the following setting:

```hotkeys.myCustomHotkey = "Ctrl + Alt + Shift + D1 = Desktop1"```

Hotkey settings always define an action. 
See [Actions Documentation](https://github.com/dankrusi/WindowsVirtualDesktopHelper/blob/main/Documentation/Actions.md)
for more information on actions.
