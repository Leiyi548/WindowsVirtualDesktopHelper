## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where is the icon showing the screen number?

Windows automatically organizes the notification area icons, and places new ones in the icons menu under the ^ chevron. You can drag the screen number into the main icon area from there to have it always showing.

### Why are the prev/next screen icons in the wrong order?

Windows automatically organizes and orders the notification area icons. You can drag prev/next screen icons to organize them accordingly.

### Why is this app is being reported by Windows Defender as untrusted?

Currently Windows Virtual Desktop Helper is not code-signed, and thus may be reported as untrusted. With USD 70 donations per year, the app will be signed.

### Why is this app is being reported by Windows Defender as malware?

Currently Windows Virtual Desktop Helper is not code-signed, and due to its installation option for installing to autostart, may be flagged as malware. Typically, after enough users download, install, and report
the software as okay/safe, this malware warning will go away. With USD 70 donations per year, the app will be signed.

### Why is the app based on the older .NET 4.7?

The idea is to make the app as easy and lightweight to run as possible. Most systems have some version of .NET installed, thus we use a low version to cover as many users as possible.
